Began working through the tutorials on the envirotyping readthedocs
	Was unable to login to stampede2 and was delayed starting the tutorials
		Before contacting Austin or tech support I spent a few hours trying to research possiblites as to why it wouldn't work, through this I learned about not only stampede but lone star 5, XSEDE and how to set up a puTTY
	Contacted both Austin and tech support and am currently working with tech support to resolve issues denying me permission to access stampede2
Worked through tutorials on while loops and for loops (R)


Most interesting problem/question this week: Not being able to login to stampede and having continuing issues caused me to spend hours at first trying to figure out why it wasn't working before I contact anyone for tech support.
 	Through this time spent trying to figure out the issue I was able to learn a lot about the services TACC offers and the different servers. One website I went to suggested setting up a puTTY and I did try that as well. If I had just gone to Austin right away I wouldn't have learned the extra things I did from researching on my own.
 	I think the most interesting thing this week was learning more than I needed to about TACC and about other ways of connecting to it if needed in future research that I wouldn't have learned if I had gone for help straight away.

	I have started seriously looking into graduate schools and have found a program that I think I would very much enjoy. Oregon state university offers a Masters degree in horticulture with a concentration in plant genetics and breeding. 
	This concentration also covers bioinformatics. To better prepare myself for the Masters program I would like to start reading more on how to run a data analysis and how to interpret it.
