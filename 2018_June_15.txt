Read manual on AlphaSim - overall the manual was very indepth and helpful in 
explaining each part of the program. I will come up with more questions as I work with 
the program, for now I have my questions listed below.  
Contacted Michael Suggs about how Alphasims is updated on Stampede along with 
installing and test functioning. Our schedules did not coincide this week, especially 
as Michael was sick while I was free during the week. However we will be meeting over 
the weekend or next week to complete this task, if our schedules do not coincide again 
Michael will be making a typed out instruction sheet. 

Questions:

Will I be running simulations using internal pedigrees or external? If external where 
will the data be coming from and how do I create a pedigree text file from it?

In the flexibility section of code I am still a little confused on the Merge 
operation, specifically what they are used for and how the coding for them works.

I have not come across the term double haploids before this and was wondering if I 
could get some clarification on their importance to plant breeding.

Curious as to how you know what exact numerical variables to input into the program, 
is it typically more trial and error? 

When I'm running my simulations what criteria will I be looking for?
